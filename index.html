  	<h1>Pointer Visualization Project </h1>
  	<h3>by Danielle Thurow </h3>
  	<p>
  		This project was built by me to help myself (and others) visualize how pointers work. This is currently only for C#, and right now it <i>kind of</i> pretends the garbage collector for C# doesn't exist. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		This also has the secondary purpose of helping me learn more about Vuejs, node/npm, and heroku, so if there's some wonkiness of this site, add an issue to the github repo. 
      Github repo is: <a href="https://github.com/Dthurow/pointer-visualization">https://github.com/Dthurow/pointer-visualization</a>
