### Info about project

This project was built by me to help myself (and others) visualize how pointers work. This is currently only for C#, and right now it kind of pretends the garbage collector for C# doesn't exist. 

This also has the secondary purpose of helping me learn more about Vuejs, node/npm, and heroku, so if there's some wonkiness of this site, add an issue here.
